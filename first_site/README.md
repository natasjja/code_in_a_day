#My First Site

##HTML

1.  Add some tags anywhere inside the `<body>` tags
2.  Add a main heading to your page using the `<h1>` tag
3.  Add an unordered list using the `<ul>` tag
4.  Add some text with a `<p>` tag
5.  Add a link to another cool website using an `<a>` tag
6.  Add an image to your page:

- Save an image and give it a simple file name (make sure there are no spaces) e.g. mypet.jpg
- Make a folder called images by right clicking in your root folder and selecting “New Folder”
- Drop the image you saved into the folder called images
- Now embed the image in the page using the `<img>` tag
- Go to https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tags_img.asp for help if you need

##CSS

1. Make sure your CSS is linked by adding the link to your CSS Stylesheet between the two `<head>` tags: `<link rel=“stylesheet” href=“css/styles.css”>`
2. Let’s centre our page with CSS

- Add a `<main>` tag around ALL the elements we’ve added inside our document body.
- Go to your CSS file and style the main by adding a `max-width`. Wrap all your CSS rules inside curly braces like this: `main { max-width: 600px; }`
- Let’s center it by using `margin: auto`;
- All CSS properties that apply to the same selector, you include in the same set of curly braces. So the
  finishes CSS above would look like: `main { max-width: 600px; margin: auto; }`

2. Add some colors

- Change the color of the `<h1>` tag
- Try changing the background color of the body and see what happens
- Try adding a custom font by yourself by going to https://fonts.google.com
